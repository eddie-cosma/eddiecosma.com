This model makes a number of assumptions that must be carefully considered.</p><ul><li>An r<sub>0</sub> value of 6.5 is used. This is based on reports from medical literature and the media in the context of the now-predominant delta variant.<sup>1,2</sup></li><li>The use of r<sub>0</sub> is inherently flawed because it assumes a completely susceptible population.<sup>3</sup> In other words, it does not account for individuals becoming less susceptible due to previous infection or vaccination. Previous estimates of r<sub>0</sub> also do not account for changes in transmissibility due to emerging vaccine variants.</li><li>The model currently assumes that a complete vaccination with a booster confers 93% protection against COVID-19, complete vaccination without a booster confers 48% protection, and a single dose confers 10% protection.<sup>4,5</sup> The efficacy of a single dose has not been studied in the context of the predominant delta variant, so this number is a guess. The model does not take into account the time it takes for immunity to be reached after vaccination and does not account for immunity waning over time.</li><li>The model calculates the rate at which people are being vaccinated and extrapolates this into the future assuming a linear vaccination rate. In reality, vaccination rates may be nonlinear or otherwise fluctuate based on a number of factors including product availability, emergency use authorization of novel vaccines, and prevailing attitudes towards vaccination.</li><li>Because data is analyzed in aggregate for the state of Ohio, the assumption is that vaccination pravalence and incidence are homogenous across the state. This is not the case. Because of differences in geographic vaccination rates, many areas may see herd immunity slower than predicted.</li></ul><p>Because of these limitations, herd immunity predictions should be viewed with a high degree of skepticism. They constitute a best-effort attempt at predicting when herd immunity will be reached, but with a high degree of variability that is itself difficult to quantify.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li>Kang M, Xin H, Yuan J, et al.
