# Hi, I'm Eddie Cosma! 👋
<img src="/img/eddie.png" style="float: right; margin: 5px;">I'm a pharmacist based in **Cleveland, OH**, with a passion for processing and analyzing healthcare data. I’m particularly interested in leveraging **AI and machine learning** to improve healthcare outcomes. When I’m not exploring data-driven solutions, I enjoy building for the web.

### 💻 Tech I Work With
- 🛠️ Primarily: **Python**, **SQL**, and **HTML/CSS**
- 🙈 Mysteriously familiar with **MUMPS** (enough to be dangerous)

### 🐍 Community Involvement
I co-host the **Cleveland Python Meetup** ([CLEpy](https://github.com/CLEpy)), where we share knowledge and nerd out over Python.

💬 Want to connect? Find me here on GitHub or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardcosma/).

My CV is available for review here: [Edward_Cosma-CV.pdf](/doc/Edward_Cosma-CV.pdf).
