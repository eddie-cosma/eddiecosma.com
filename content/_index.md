# About me
I am a Pharmacy Informatics Specialist at [MetroHealth Medical Center](https://www.metrohealth.org) in Cleveland,&nbsp;OH. I graduated from the College of Pharmacy at [The University of Toledo](http://www.utoledo.edu) and completed a PGY-1 Pharmacy Practice residency at [University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center](http://www.uhhospitals.org). Outside of pharmacy, I enjoy reading fiction and photographing anything and everything.
